# MPI-Kmeans-FarFirst
This project is very similar to the OpenMP Kmeans/Farfirst project in that the goal is to code a parallel implementation of the Kmeans clustering algorithm using the 
Farthest First center selection algorithm in addition in order to perform clustering and classification on a list of coordinate points from the .dat files.
